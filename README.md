edirc
=====

ed is the standard text editor.  
edirc is a bot that lets you use it on irc.

One file per user/channel, reading and writing to other files is disabled.  
It won't write more than 3 lines per second to avoid flooding.  
The data can be exported to a pastebin with the X command.

The source is mostly from GNU ed 1.10, the license is GNU GPL v3.

You can try it out in freenode, it replies via pm and in #edirc.  
In channels it ignores every message that doesn't start with , (comma).

Enjoy.
